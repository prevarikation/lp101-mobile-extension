# LP102 (a LP101 mobile extension)
[lockpicking101.com][1] is a deep resource for hobbyist lockpickers, but the site has not yet been updated to be clearly readable on a mobile device. This add-on applies tweaks to the existing site for a more pleasant mobile viewing experience.

Changes include:
1. Site gracefully responds to windows of different sizes, turning the left menus into a dropdown selection when appropriate.
2. Announcements and stickied threads are collapsed by default unless there are new posts in a thread. They can be expanded by tapping on the associated header.
3. Forum descriptions are collapsed by default on a mobile device.

## Installation
It can be installed through [Firefox Add-ons][2], but Android installation requires:
* [Firefox Nightly for Developers][3]
* [a workaround for installing add-ons from a collection on addons.mozilla.org][4].

This add-on has not been tested in other browsers.
